You: What key economic factors influenced Ford's performance in 2021?
Querying with: What were the key economic factors that influenced Ford's financial performance in 2021?

Assistant: In 2021, Ford's financial performance was influenced by several key economic factors:

1. Special Items: The year-over-year increase of $19.2 billion in net income/(loss) in 2021 includes the effect of special items, including the Rivian IPO and mark-to-market gain.

2. Automotive EBIT and Ford Credit EBT: Higher Automotive EBIT and Ford Credit EBT also contributed to the increase in net income/(loss) and Company adjusted EBIT.

3. Semiconductor Shortage: The global semiconductor shortage had a significant impact on Ford's financial performance in 2021. It resulted in lower wholesale receivables due to lower dealer inventories and lower volume for Ford Credit.

4. Used Vehicle Demand: Ford Credit’s U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were up 26% from 2020, reflecting strong demand for used vehicles, including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage.

5. Operating Lease Residual Performance and Credit Loss Reserve: Ford Credit’s 2021 EBT increased $2,109 million from 2020, explained primarily by favorable operating lease residual performance, the non-recurrence of the 2020 increase to the credit loss reserve due to deterioration in macroeconomic conditions related to COVID-19, and reductions in the credit loss reserve in 2021.

6. Interest Expense: Ford's full year 2021 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was $1,803 million, $154 million higher than in 2020, primarily explained by higher U.S. unsecured debt interest expense.

7. Tax Benefits: Ford's Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2021 was a $130 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 0.7%. This includes a benefit of $2.9 billion to recognize deferred tax assets resulting from changes in their global tax structure and a $918 million benefit from the reversal of U.S. valuation allowances.

8. Capital Spending: Capital spending was $6.2 billion in 2021, $0.5 billion higher than a year ago.

9. Working Capital and Timing Differences: The full year 2021 working capital impact was $1.7 billion negative, driven by higher inventory. All other and timing differences were negative $3.1 billion, reflecting assorted differences including differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated cash flows.
